# selenium-automation

This is specifically for storing my automated tasks using python-selenium.

As of now, the script go throught my recent project http://13.40.12.147/ and take screenshots of all the pages by logging in and uploading files 
to verify if everything is working as expected.

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the username and password in it.
